# AutoFlow

AutoFlow is a **Rust-based command-line tool** designed to automate repetitive project tasks.  
It helps developers quickly initialize project structures, manage files, and run workflows efficiently.  

## Features
- CLI interface for easy navigation
- Automates project directory creation and configuration files
- Runs scripts and checks project status
- Reduces human errors in repetitive tasks
- Demonstrates Rust’s speed and reliability

## Technical Implementation
- Written in Rust, using Cargo for dependency management
- Project structure:
  - `src/main.rs` – CLI logic and automation tasks
  - `Cargo.toml` – dependencies and metadata
  - `README.md` – project documentation
  - `index.html` – website demo (GitHub Pages)
- Modular and scalable code for maintainability

## Technologies Used

- Rust – memory-safe, fast, and reliable system programming
- Cargo – build and dependency management
- Clap – command-line argument parsing
- Git & GitHub – version control
- GitHub Pages – live project website
- Cross-compilation – Linux x86_64 and ARM aarch64

## Design Decisions

- Rust: Chosen for performance and safety
-  CLI interface: Lightweight and fast, no GUI overhead
- Modular code structure: Improves readability and maintainability
- Cross-compilation: Demonstrates flexibility for Linux platforms
- Safe file movement: Prevents data loss or overwriting

## Advantages

- Saves time by automating repetitive tasks
- Reduces human error
- Lightweight and fast
- Cross-platform Linux compatibility
- Scalable and maintainable code

## Future Enhancements

- GUI interface for easier use
- User-defined rules for file organization
- Logging and reporting system
- Scheduled automation (cron / Task Scheduler)
- Cloud integration for project syncing
